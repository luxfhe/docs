# Lux FHE

**Compute on encrypted data without ever decrypting it.**

Lux FHE is an open-source ecosystem for building privacy-preserving applications using Fully Homomorphic Encryption.

## What is FHE?

Fully Homomorphic Encryption allows computations on encrypted data. The server performing the computation never sees the plaintext data.

```python
from luxfhe import Client, Server

# Client encrypts sensitive data
client = Client()
encrypted_data = client.encrypt(sensitive_value)

# Server computes on encrypted data
server = Server(client.evaluation_key)
result = server.add(encrypted_data, encrypted_other)

# Client decrypts result
plaintext_result = client.decrypt(result)
# Server NEVER saw sensitive_value!
```

## Use Cases

### Private Machine Learning
Train and run models on encrypted data. Patient records, financial data, and sensitive information stay encrypted throughout.

### Private Agents
AI agents operate on encrypted context. Your personal data never leaves your control.

### Confidential Computing
Execute business logic on encrypted inputs. Trade secrets and competitive data stay private.

### Private Smart Contracts
Blockchain applications with encrypted state. Balances, votes, and bids remain confidential.
